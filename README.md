# Dune-HPDG

## Summary
For my research concerning hp-adaptive methods for nonlinear problems (in particular phase-field models), I need several extra classes that go beyond the scope of the standard dune models. However, I don't want to pollute my branches of e.g. dune-functions or dune-localfunctions too much, hence these classes are placed in this module.
